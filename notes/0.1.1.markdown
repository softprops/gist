### Privacy expectations

After creating a [gist][gist], you can't change it's privacy. The `-p` flag which creates a private gist is hard to remember so it's easy to post private content. Gists generated with `gist` are now __private by default__. The `-p` flag now means "make this gist public"

Below are a few examples you can run in your favorite terminal emulator.

    $ open $(echo "test private" | gist --)

    $ open $(echo "test public" | gist -- -p)

#### Dispatch upgrade

I also took the liberty of updating this version with the latest version of [dispatch][dp]

Get the latest version with [conscript][cs]
