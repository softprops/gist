### Privacy expectations

After creating a gist, you can't change it's privacy. It's easy to forget `-p` flag is hard to remember so its easy to post private content. Gists generated with `gist` are now private by default. The `-p` flag now means "make this gist public"

Below are a few examples

    $ open $(echo "test private" | gist --)

    $ open $(echo "test public" | gist -- -p)

#### Dispatch upgrade

Get the latest version with [conscript][cs]
